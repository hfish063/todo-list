# todo-list
## Description
**todo-list** is a basic full-stack application utilizing Java (Springboot) as the back-end API, and Reactjs for the front-end.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate my Javacript skills as I am in the process of learning the React framework, ontop of some Spring shenanigans of which I have a decent amount of experience working with.

## Additional Info
This project is intended as an academic example to demonstrate my skills, there are no plans current (or future) to host this service for public consumption.  It is possible to run it on your local machine by cloning this repository, however this process will require proficiency in both **Springboot** and **React**.
