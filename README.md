# todo-list
## Description
**todo-list** is a basic full-stack application utilizing Java (Springboot) as the back-end API, and Reactjs for the front-end.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate my Javacript skills as I am in the process of learning the React framework, ontop of some Spring shenanigans of which I have a decent amount of experience working with.
